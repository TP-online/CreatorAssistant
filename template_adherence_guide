# 🎯 AI Template Adherence Control Guide  

> **Control how closely the AI follows your comment templates**  

## 📋 Overview  
Template Adherence lets you balance **creativity vs. structure** when generating comments. Adjust it in **AI Tools → Template Adherence Control** using the **real-time slider** (0.0 – 1.0).  

---

## ⚙️ Configuration  

| Slider Position | Behavior | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **0.0 - 0.3** | Very Creative | Loose inspiration, highly natural |
| **0.4 - 0.6** | Balanced | Mix of structure + creativity |
| **0.7 - 0.9** | Template-Focused | Closely follows template |
| **1.0** | Strict Template | Exact structure, no changes |

🔒 **Important:** Content wrapped in `*asterisks*` (CTAs, links) is **always preserved**, regardless of adherence.

## 🎨 Examples  

**Template:**  
```
"Great video! *Subscribe to my channel* for more content. *Check out my website* for resources."
```  

**Video:** *How to Trade Bitcoin in 2025*  

| Adherence | AI Output | Behavior |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **0.2 (Creative)** | "Wow, this Bitcoin guide is exactly what I needed! *Subscribe to my channel* for more crypto insights. *Check out my website* for advanced strategies." | Conversational, adds context |
| **0.5 (Balanced)** | "Great video on Bitcoin trading! Really helpful insights for 2025. *Subscribe to my channel* for more crypto content. *Check out my website* for additional resources." | Balanced, relevant |
| **0.8 (Template-Focused)** | "Great video! *Subscribe to my channel* for more content. *Check out my website* for some other resources." | Mostly template, minor edits |
| **1.0 (Strict)** | "Great video! *Subscribe to my channel* for more content. *Check out my website* for resources." | Exact template |
